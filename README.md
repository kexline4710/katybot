It's about time I kept track of my dotfiles and the applications I like.

## Computer Setup

- Map `caps lock` to `control` in the mac [modifier keys](https://support.apple.com/kb/PH25240?locale=en_US).
- Install [homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
- Generate [ssh key](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent/): to ssh all the things
- mkdir ~/Development

## Applications

### Productivity

- [Spectacle](https://www.spectacleapp.com/): preferred window manager
- [Caffeine](http://lightheadsw.com/caffeine/): Keeps my mac awake
- [1Password](https://1password.com/): Password manager for work and personal

### Development

- [iTerm](https://www.iterm2.com/): Preferred terminal emulator

### Fun
- [Slack](https://slack.com/): For work and personal community chat
- [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/us/): Where I get the musics. I have a growing [collection of movie scores](https://open.spotify.com/user/1248745171/playlist/4UtBI0rX29svSEbDtJtAJA) that I listen to all...the...time.

## Resources

- The [dotphiles project](https://github.com/dotphiles/dotphiles): There seem to be a lot of really great contributors here. I used this to double check a few things that I may be missing.
- [dotfiles](https://dotfiles.github.io/): The unofficial guide to dotfiles on GitHub.
